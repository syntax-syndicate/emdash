# emdash

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#600](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/600) [`9295cc1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9295cc199f72c9b9adff236e4a72ba412604493f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds Noto Sans as the default admin UI font via the Astro Font API. Fonts are downloaded from Google at build time and self-hosted. The base font covers Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Devanagari, and Vietnamese. Additional scripts (Arabic, CJK, Hebrew, Thai, etc.) can be added via the new `fonts.scripts` config option. Set `fonts: false` to disable and use system fonts.

### Patch Changes

- [#595](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/595) [`cfd01f3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cfd01f3bd484b38549a5a164ad006279a2024788) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes playground initialization crash caused by syncSearchState attempting first-time FTS enablement during field creation.

- [#605](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/605) [`445b3bf`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/445b3bfecf1f4cdc109be865685eb6ae6e0c06e6) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes D1 read replicas being bypassed for anonymous public page traffic. The middleware fast path now asks the database adapter for a per-request scoped Kysely, so anonymous reads land on the nearest replica instead of the primary-pinned singleton binding.

  All D1-specific semantics (Sessions API, constraint selection, bookmark cookie) live in `@emdash-cms/cloudflare/db/d1` behind a single `createRequestScopedDb(opts)` function. Core middleware has no D1-specific logic. Adapters opt in via a new `supportsRequestScope: boolean` flag on `DatabaseDescriptor`; `d1()` sets it to true.

  Other fixes in the same change:
  - Nested `runWithContext` calls in the request-context middleware now merge the parent context instead of replacing it, so an outer per-request db override is preserved through edit/preview flows.
  - Baseline security headers now forward Astro's cookie symbol across the response clone so `cookies.set()` calls in middleware survive.
  - Any write (authenticated or anonymous) now forces `first-primary`, so an anonymous form/comment POST isn't racing across replicas.
  - The session user is read once per request and reused in both the fast path and the full runtime init (previously read twice on authenticated public-page traffic).
  - Bookmark cookies are validated only for length (≤1024) and absence of control characters — no stricter shape check, so a future D1 bookmark format change won't silently degrade consistency.
  - The `!config` bail-out now still applies baseline security headers.
  - `__ec_d1_bookmark` references aligned to `__em_d1_bookmark` across runtime, docs, and JSDoc.

- [#500](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/500) [`14c923b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/14c923b5eaf23f6e601cd2559ce9fc3af2f40822) Thanks [@all3f0r1](https://github.com/all3f0r1)! - Adds inline term creation in the post editor taxonomy sidebar. Tags show a "Create" option when no match exists; categories get an "Add new" button below the list.

- [#606](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/606) [`c5ef0f5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c5ef0f5befda129e4040822ee341f8cd8bb5acaf) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Caches the manifest in memory and in the database to eliminate N+1 schema queries per request. Batches site info queries during initialization. Cold starts read 1 cached row instead of rebuilding from scratch.

- [#465](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/465) [`0a61ef4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0a61ef412ef8d2643fa847caeddbe8b8933d3fc7) Thanks [@Pouf5](https://github.com/Pouf5)! - Fixes FTS5 tables not being created when a searchable collection is created or updated via the Admin UI.

- [#558](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/558) [`629fe1d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/629fe1dd3094a0178c57529a455a2be805b08ad0) Thanks [@csfalcao](https://github.com/csfalcao)! - Fixes `/_emdash/api/search/suggest` 500 error. `getSuggestions` no longer double-appends the FTS5 prefix operator `*` on top of the one `escapeQuery` already adds, so autocomplete queries like `?q=des` now return results instead of raising `SqliteError: fts5: syntax error near "*"`.

- [#552](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/552) [`f52154d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f52154da8afb838b1af6deccf33b5a261257ec7c) Thanks [@masonjames](https://github.com/masonjames)! - Fixes passkey login failures so unregistered or invalid credentials return an authentication failure instead of an internal server error.

- [#598](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/598) [`8fb93eb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8fb93eb045eb529eafd83e451ec673106f5bdb3c) Thanks [@maikunari](https://github.com/maikunari)! - Fixes WordPress import error reporting to surface the real exception message instead of a generic "Failed to import item" string, making import failures diagnosable.

- [#582](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/582) [`04e6cca`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/04e6ccaa939f184edf4129eea0edf8ac5185d018) Thanks [@all3f0r1](https://github.com/all3f0r1)! - Improves the "Failed to create database" error to detect NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatches from better-sqlite3 and surface an actionable message telling the user to rebuild the native module.

- Updated dependencies [[`0b32b2f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0b32b2f3906bf5bfed313044af6371480d43edc1), [`913cb62`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/913cb6239510f9959581cb74a70faa53a462a9aa), [`6c92d58`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6c92d58767dc92548136a87cc90c1c6912da6695), [`a2d5afb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a2d5afbb19b5bcaf98464d354322fa737a8b9ba0), [`f52154d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f52154da8afb838b1af6deccf33b5a261257ec7c)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#540](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/540) [`82c6345`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/82c63451ff05ddc0a8e2777c124907358814da2b) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Adds `where: { status?, locale? }` to `ContentListOptions`, letting plugins narrow `ContentAccess.list()` results at the database layer instead of filtering the returned array. The underlying repository already supports these filters — this PR only exposes them through the plugin-facing type.

- [#551](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/551) [`598026c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/598026c99083325c281b9e7ab87e9724e11f2c8d) Thanks [@ophirbucai](https://github.com/ophirbucai)! - Adds RTL (right-to-left) language support infrastructure. Enables proper text direction for RTL languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, and Urdu. Includes LocaleDirectionProvider component that syncs HTML dir/lang attributes with Kumo's DirectionProvider for automatic layout mirroring when locale changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#542](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/542) [`64f90d1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/64f90d1957af646ca200b9d70e856fa72393f001) Thanks [@mohamedmostafa58](https://github.com/mohamedmostafa58)! - Fixes invite flow: corrects invite URL to point to admin UI page, adds InviteAcceptPage for passkey registration.

- [#555](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/555) [`197bc1b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/197bc1bdcb16012138a95b46a1e31530bde8c5ab) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes OAuth authorization server metadata discovery for MCP clients by serving it at the RFC 8414-compliant path.

- [#534](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/534) [`ce873f8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ce873f8fa618aa175598726a60230b4c36d37e2e) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Fixes Table block to render inline marks (bold, italic, code, links, etc.) through the Portable Text pipeline instead of stripping them to plain text. Links are sanitized via `sanitizeHref()`. Table styles now use CSS custom properties with fallbacks.

- Updated dependencies [[`9ea4cf7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9ea4cf7c63cd5a1c45ec569bd72076c935066a1c), [`64f90d1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/64f90d1957af646ca200b9d70e856fa72393f001), [`598026c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/598026c99083325c281b9e7ab87e9724e11f2c8d)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#539](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/539) [`8ed7969`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8ed7969df2c95790d7c635ef043df20bb21b6156) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Adds `locale` to the `ContentItem` type returned by the plugin content access API. Follow-up to #536 — plugins that build i18n URLs from content records need the locale to pick the right URL prefix, otherwise multilingual content is emitted at default-locale URLs.

- [#523](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/523) [`5d9120e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5d9120eca846dd7c446d05f1b9c14fe1b7e394ec) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Add `nlweb` to the allowed `rel` values for `page:metadata` link contributions, letting plugins inject `<link rel="nlweb" href="...">` tags for agent/conversational endpoint discovery.

- [#536](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/536) [`9318c56`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9318c5684fb293f167cd3e6f9e9a3ca12f042d7b) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Adds `slug`, `status`, and `publishedAt` to the `ContentItem` type returned by the plugin content access API. Exports `ContentPublishStateChangeEvent` type. Fires `afterDelete` hooks on permanent content deletion.

- [#519](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/519) [`5c0776d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5c0776deee7005ba580fc7dc8f778e805ab82cef) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Enables the MCP server endpoint by default. The endpoint at `/_emdash/api/mcp` requires bearer token auth, so it has no effect unless a client is configured. Set `mcp: false` to disable.

  Fixes MCP server crash ("exports is not defined") on Cloudflare in dev mode by pre-bundling the MCP SDK's CJS dependencies for workerd.

### Patch Changes

- [#515](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/515) [`5beddc3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5beddc31785aa7de086b2b22a2a9612f9d1c8aaf) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Reduces logged-out page load queries by caching byline existence, URL patterns, and redirect rules at worker level with proper invalidation.

- [#512](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/512) [`f866c9c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f866c9cc0dd1ac62035ef3e06bbe8d8d7d1c44a0) Thanks [@mahesh-projects](https://github.com/mahesh-projects)! - Fixes save/publish race condition in visual editor toolbar. When a user blurred a field and immediately clicked Publish, the in-flight save PUT could arrive at the server after the publish POST, causing the stale revision to be promoted silently. Introduces `pendingSavePromise` so `publish()` chains onto the pending save rather than firing immediately.

- [#537](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/537) [`1acf174`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1acf1743e7116a5f00b11536306ebb55edbf3b2e) Thanks [@Glacier-Luo](https://github.com/Glacier-Luo)! - Fixes plugin bundle resolving dist path before source, which caused build failures and potential workspace-wide source file destruction.

- [#538](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/538) [`678cc8c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/678cc8c4c34a23e8a7aeda652b0ec87070983b07) Thanks [@Glacier-Luo](https://github.com/Glacier-Luo)! - Fixes revision pruning crash on PostgreSQL by replacing column alias in HAVING clause with the aggregate expression.

- [#509](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/509) [`d56f6c1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d56f6c1d2a688eee46e96a1dbe2d8c894ffc7095) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Fixes TypeError when setting baseline security headers on Cloudflare responses with immutable headers.

- [#495](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/495) [`2a7c68a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2a7c68a9f6c88216eb3f599b942b63fec8e1ae31) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes atomicity gaps: content update \_rev check, menu reorder, byline delete, and seed content creation now run inside transactions.

- [#497](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/497) [`6492ea2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6492ea202c5872132c952678862eb6f564c78b7c) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes migration 011 rollback, plugin media upload returning wrong ID, MCP taxonomy tools bypassing validation, and FTS query escaping logic.

- [#517](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/517) [`b382357`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b38235702fd075d95c04b2a6874804ca45baa721) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Improves plugin safety: hooks log dependency cycles, timeouts clear timers, routes don't leak error internals, one-shot cron tasks retry with exponential backoff (max 5), marketplace downloads validate redirect targets.

- [#532](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/532) [`1b743ac`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1b743acc35750dc36de4acdd95164c34cd7d092f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes cold-start query explosion (159 -> ~25 queries) by short-circuiting migrations when all are applied, fixing FTS triggers to exclude soft-deleted content, and preventing false-positive FTS index rebuilds on every startup.

- Updated dependencies [[`3a96aa7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3a96aa7f5671f6c718ab066e02c61fb55b33d901), [`c869df2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c869df2b08decae6dc9c85bdfca83cc6577203cf), [`10ebfe1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/10ebfe19b81feacfe99cfaf2daf4976eaac17bd4), [`275a21c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/275a21c389c121cbac6daa6be497ae3b6c1bfc6d), [`af0647c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/af0647c7352922ad63077613771150d8178263ed), [`b89e7f3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b89e7f3811488ebe8fbe28068baa18f7f25844ad), [`20b03b4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/20b03b480156a5c901298a1ab9c968c800179215), [`ba0a5af`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ba0a5afccf110465b72916e23db4ff975d81bc2e), [`e2f96aa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e2f96aa74bd936832a3a4d0636e81f948adb51c7), [`4645103`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4645103f06ae9481b07dba14af07ac0ff57e32cf)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#457](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/457) [`f2b3973`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f2b39739c13cbef86ed16be007f08abf86b0f9ca) Thanks [@UpperM](https://github.com/UpperM)! - Adds runtime resolution of S3 storage config from `S3_*` environment
  variables (`S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
  `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`). Any field omitted from
  `s3({...})` is read from the matching env var on Node at runtime, so
  container images can be built once and receive credentials at boot without a
  rebuild. Explicit values in `s3({...})` still take precedence.

  `s3()` with no arguments is now valid for fully env-driven deployments.
  `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` are now optional in `S3StorageConfig`
  (both or neither). Workers users should continue passing explicit values to
  `s3({...})`.

### Patch Changes

The version and git commit SHA are now injected at build time via tsdown/Vite `define`, reading from package.json and `git rev-parse`.

- [#494](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/494) [`a283954`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a28395455cec14cea6d382a604e2598ead097d99) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds defensive identifier validation to all SQL interpolation points to prevent injection via dynamic identifiers.

### Minor Changes

- [#367](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/367) [`8f44ec2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8f44ec23a4b23f636f9689c075d29edfa4962c7c) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Adds `content:afterPublish` and `content:afterUnpublish` plugin hooks, fired after content is published or unpublished. Both are fire-and-forget notifications requiring `read:content` capability, supporting trusted and sandboxed plugins.

- [#431](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/431) [`7ee7d95`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7ee7d95ee32df2b1915144030569382fe97aef3d) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Per-collection sitemaps with sitemap index and lastmod

  `/sitemap.xml` now serves a `<sitemapindex>` with one child sitemap per SEO-enabled collection. Each collection's sitemap is at `/sitemap-{collection}.xml` with `<lastmod>` on both index entries and individual URLs. Uses the collection's `url_pattern` for correct URL building.

- [#414](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/414) [`4d4ac53`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4d4ac536eeb664b7d0ca9f1895a51960a47ecafe) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Adds `breadcrumbs?: BreadcrumbItem[]` to `PublicPageContext` so themes can publish a breadcrumb trail as part of the page context, and SEO plugins (or any other `page:metadata` consumer) can read it without having to invent their own per-theme override mechanism. `BreadcrumbItem` is also exported from the `emdash` package root. The field is optional and non-breaking — existing themes and plugins work unchanged, and consumers can adopt it incrementally. Empty array (`breadcrumbs: []`) is an explicit opt-out signal (e.g. for homepages); `undefined` means "no opinion, fall back to consumer's own derivation".

- [#111](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/111) [`87b0439`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/87b0439927454a275833992de4244678b47b9aa3) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Adds repeater field type for structured repeating data

- [#382](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/382) [`befaeec`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/befaeecfefd968d14693e96e3cdaa691ffabe7d3) Thanks [@UpperM](https://github.com/UpperM)! - Adds `siteUrl` config option to fix reverse-proxy origin mismatch. Replaces `passkeyPublicOrigin` with a single setting that covers all origin-dependent features: passkeys, CSRF, OAuth, auth redirects, MCP discovery, snapshots, sitemap, robots.txt, and JSON-LD.

  Supports `EMDASH_SITE_URL` / `SITE_URL` environment variables for container deployments where the domain is only known at runtime.

  Disables Astro's `security.checkOrigin` (EmDash's own CSRF layer handles origin validation with dual-origin support and runtime siteUrl resolution). When `siteUrl` is set in config, also sets `security.allowedDomains` so `Astro.url` reflects the public origin in templates.

  **Breaking:** `passkeyPublicOrigin` is removed. Rename to `siteUrl` in your `astro.config.mjs`.

  to the core SEO panel. When the input `data` contains a reserved `seo` key,
  it is now extracted and routed to `_emdash_seo` via the SEO repository,
  matching the REST API shape. `ctx.content.get()` and `ctx.content.list()`
  also hydrate the `seo` field on returned items for SEO-enabled collections.

Uses `wp:post_date_gmt` (UTC) with fallback chain to `pubDate` (RFC 2822) then `wp:post_date` (site-local). Handles the WordPress `0000-00-00 00:00:00` sentinel for unpublished drafts. Sets `published_at` for published posts. Applies to both WXR file upload and plugin-based import paths.

The middleware's early-return fast-path for unauthenticated requests now initializes the runtime (skipping only the manifest query), so plugin contributions render via `<EmDashHead>`, `<EmDashBodyStart>`, and `<EmDashBodyEnd>` for all visitors. Also adds `collectPageMetadata` and `collectPageFragments` to the `EmDashHandlers` interface.

- [#424](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/424) [`476cb3a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/476cb3a585d30acb2d4d172f94c5d2b4e5b6377b) Thanks [@csfalcao](https://github.com/csfalcao)! - Fixes public access to the search API (#104). The auth middleware blocked `/_emdash/api/search` before the handler ran, so #107's handler-level change never took effect for anonymous callers. Adds the endpoint to `PUBLIC_API_EXACT` so the shipped `LiveSearch` component works on public sites without credentials. Admin endpoints (`/search/enable`, `/search/rebuild`, `/search/stats`, `/search/suggest`) remain authenticated.

Uses the site's request origin as a stable hash seed for accurate per-site deduplication. Denormalizes install_count on the marketplace plugins table for query performance.

- [#214](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/214) [`e9a6f7a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e9a6f7ac3ceeaf5c2d0a557e4cf6cab5f3d7d764) Thanks [@SARAMALI15792](https://github.com/SARAMALI15792)! - Optimizes D1 database indexes to eliminate full table scans in admin panel. Adds

  updated_at/created_at + id) and rewrites comment counting to use partial indexes.
  Reduces D1 row reads by 90%+ for dashboard operations.

- [#107](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/107) [`b297fdd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b297fdd88dadcabeb93f47abea9f24f70b7d4b71) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Allows public access to search API for frontend LiveSearch

Validates the value at integration load time and threads it through all passkey-related API routes.

  Updates the admin passkey setup and login flows to detect non-secure origins and explain that passkeys need HTTPS or `http://localhost` rather than implying the browser lacks WebAuthn support.

Fixes crashes when importing sites using plugins (Elementor, WooCommerce, ACF, etc.) that register post types with hyphens, uppercase letters, or other characters invalid in EmDash collection slugs. Reserved collection slugs are prefixed with `wp_` to avoid conflicts.

### Patch Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2) [`b09bfd5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b09bfd51cece5e88fe8314668a591ab11de36b4d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix virtual module resolution errors when emdash is installed from npm on Cloudflare. The esbuild dependency pre-bundler was encountering `virtual:emdash/*` imports while crawling dist files and failing to resolve them. These are now excluded from the optimizeDeps scan.
